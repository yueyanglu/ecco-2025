    "# Running ECCO Adjoint and Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "ECCO Ocean State Estimation uses an iterative optimization process to adjust control variables—including ocean surface forcing, mixing parameters, and initial conditions—to minimize the weighted sum of model–data misfits, called the cost function (**J**), in a least-squares sense. This iterative process involves tens of iterations. Each iteration includes one forward run to compute the model–data misfit (**J**), one adjoint run to compute the adjoint gradients (i.e., the sensitivity of **J** to the controls), and an optimization step that uses these gradients to estimate updated control adjustments. The typical steps for conducting multiple iterations, starting from initial control variables (called first-guess controls), are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Execute the forward model** using a set of first-guess model control variables to compute the model-data misfits and the initial value of the cost function, **J**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the adjoint model**, forced by the model–data misfits from the forward simulation as inputs. Upon completion, the adjoint gradients of **J** with respect to the control variables are computed. These adjoint gradients will be used in step 3 to compute updated control adjustments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute control adjustments**, called **optimization**, by utilizing the adjoint gradients and **J** fromm steps 1 and 2 to compute a set of adjustments to the control variables using the method of **steepest descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Execute the forward model** again using the updated control variables—i.e., the sum of the first-guess values (or those from the previous iteration) and the adjustments computed in step 3—and compute the new value of **J**.  \n",
    "   *This step is equivalent to step 1, except the control variables are no longer the first guess.*\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the adjoint model** (repeating step 2) to run the adjoint model and compute a new set of adjoint gradients.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update control adjustments**, another **optimization** step by applying the adjoint gradients, updated control variables, and **J** from the previous two or more iterations (up to 4 iterations to limit memory usage when producing ECCO V4 estimates) to calculate a new set of control adjustments using a **quasi-Newton** method, such as Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno algorithm (**L-BFGS**). Except for using the L-BFGS method, step 6 is essentially the same as step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Repeat step 4** using the latest control variable adjustments, and continue this cycle until **J** is sufficiently minimized. The final control adjustments, combined with the first-guess controls, constitute the optimized controls used to conduct a **forward simulation** to produce the final ECCO release, such as ECCO Version 4 Release 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, a forward run and an adjoint run, such as steps 1 and 2 (or steps 4 and 5) are often executed in a single model run that has both forward and adjoint modes. We have described how to conduct a forward simulation in [Reproducing ECCO Version 4 Release 4](./reproducing_v4r4.ipynb). In this tutorial, we describe how to run the ECCO adjoint model and conduct optimization (steps 3 or 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 3 and 6 conduct a line search that identifies a direction along which **J** can be reduced and then calculates a step size to adjust the controls in order to reduce **J**. The two line search methods are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Steepest descent (Step 3):** a first-derivative method that uses the gradient as the search direction  \n",
    "- **Quasi-Newton method (Step 6):** a method that uses second-derivative (curvature) information and often achieves faster **J** reduction\n",

    "### Overview of the Iteration Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we use an example run script to describe the detailed steps for conducting adjoint runs and optimization. The script automates the iteration process by performing three iterations (iterations 0 to 2) over a short 3-day model integration, from 12Z on January 1, 1992, to 12Z on January 3, 1992. It uses the ECCO V4r4 configuration but starts from a cold start, in which all control adjustments are set to zero. The run is named `v4r4_coldstart`, and the total wall clock time for completing the three iterations is under 45 minutes.\n",

The script extracts the total cost `fc` (referred to as `f0`) from the `costfunction0000` file in the run directory for iteration 0 (which is `v4r4_coldstart.iter0` in this case). The target cost reduction is set to 0.4% relative to `f0`, and accordingly, `fmin` is computed as 99.8% of `f0`. `fmin` is used during the line search in the steepest descent step to estimate a step size. This step size is expected to produce control adjustments that yield a cost reduction matching the target.\n",
